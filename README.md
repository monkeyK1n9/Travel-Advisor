## Introduction
This project makes use of the [Travel Advisor API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/) to display beautiful restaurants, hotels and attraction points for your next trip. You can have a look [here](https://travel-advisorxyz.netlify.app/). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
